            Each player rolls their dice. Players take turns 
            bidding on the number of dice with a certain face value.
            The next player must either raise the bid or doubt the
            previous bid. 
            <br>
            If the bid is doubted, all dice are revealed. Whoever was wrong
            loses either a life or some dice (see loss mode setting).
            The game continues until only one player has lives remaining.
            <br>
            Dice showing a 1 ⚀ are wild and can be used as any face value,
            but you cannot bid on ones.
            <br>
            Use the arrow keys to change your bid and press <span class="keys">Enter</span> to submit.
            Press <span class="keys">Backspace</span> to doubt.
