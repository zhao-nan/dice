            Every player rolls 5 dice. Players take turns 
            bidding on the number of dice with a certain face value.
            The next player must either raise the bid or doubt the
            previous bid. 
            <br>
            If the bid is doubted, all dice are revealed
            and the loser loses a life. The game continues until only
            one player has lives remaining.
            <br>
            Dice showing a 1 ⚀ are wild and can be used as any face value,
            but you cannot bid on ones.
            <br>
            Use the arrow keys to change your bid and press "Enter" to submit.
            Press "d" to doubt.
